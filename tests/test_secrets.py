"""Guard tests: no real secret may reach a git-tracked file.

Context: the CLAUDE.md audit found a live Hugging Face access token sitting in a
local ``.env``. It was correctly gitignored and blocked by ``guard-paths.sh``,
so it never reached the repo — but "never reached the repo" was luck plus one
convenience hook, not something CI could prove. These tests turn that into an
enforced invariant:

  * no tracked file may contain a recognizable secret (HF / GitHub token, PEM
    private key, AWS access-key id);
  * the secret-bearing files themselves (``.env`` / non-template ``.env.*``,
    ``secrets.toml``) must never be tracked.

They scan ``git ls-files`` (so a gitignored local ``.env`` is invisible here,
exactly as it should be) and run in CI on every push/PR. This is a *detective*
control: a push reaches GitHub before CI runs, so on a public repo treat any hit
as an already-published secret to rotate — the guard makes that impossible to
miss and fails any later commit that reintroduces it. The detector is
self-tested below so a broken (or newly added, untested) regex can't let the
guard pass vacuously.

Note: files are scanned as raw bytes, so a single non-UTF-8 byte can't hide an
ASCII secret by making the whole file undecodable; and the sample secrets in the
detector self-test are built by concatenation, so no contiguous secret literal
exists in this file — which ``test_no_secret_in_tracked_files`` also scans.
