"""Contract tests for the project's license declaration.

The repo shipped for several versions with no license at all — which under
copyright law means *all rights reserved*, so nobody could legally fork or reuse
the public code. It is now MIT, declared in three places that must stay
consistent or the guarantee silently rots:

  * ``LICENSE`` — the canonical MIT text. GitHub's Licensee detector matches the
    wording, so an emptied or reworded file drops the repo's "MIT License" badge
    and blanks the ``licenseInfo`` API field.
  * ``pyproject.toml`` — ``license = "MIT"`` (a PEP 639 SPDX string), so the
    packaging metadata agrees with the file.
  * ``README.md`` — a public-facing License section that links the file and
    credits the permissive upstreams.

These tests tie the three together against one ``_EXPECTED_SPDX`` source of
truth: relicense one without the others and CI fails, exactly as ``test_ci.py``
ties ``.python-version`` to ``requires-python``.
