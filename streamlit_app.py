# Start width of the sidebar in px (set_page_config accepts 200-600; Streamlit's
# default is 300). An int keeps "auto" behavior -- expanded on desktop,
# collapsed on narrow viewports. 320 is the narrowest that keeps every example
# label to two lines (at 300 two of them wrap to three, growing the sidebar
# from 931 to 998px and pushing the model caption past an 880px fold) and the
# Width | Height pair side by side inside Advanced settings; every px it gives
# back widens the canvas.

# The canvas. st.image has no height parameter and Streamlit exposes no
# viewport size to Python, so a picture's drawn height is bounded through its
# width, two ways at once:
#  - CANVAS_HEIGHT_RATIO: the picture's column spans min(1, aspect x ratio) of
#    the main area, so any aspect is drawn at most ratio x main-area-width tall.
#    It tracks the window: with the sidebar open, 0.6 keeps picture and seed
#    caption on screen in laptop-shaped windows down to 1280x720 and 1440x790.
#    At viewports of 640px or less Streamlit stacks the columns and the
#    picture spans the full width, so only the cap below bounds it there.
#  - CANVAS_MAX_HEIGHT: _canvas's inner frame, which st.image stretches to
#    fill, gets width = max height x aspect, and Streamlit caps an int
#    container width to its column. It holds where the main area widens
#    without the window growing taller -- a collapsed sidebar, or a 16:9
#    monitor, where 0.6 x width alone would overshoot the fold -- in windows
#    at least 842px tall; shorter ones with the sidebar collapsed clip.
